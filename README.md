# Google App Store EDA

This is Day#14 Assignment for Codanics Data Science Mentorship Programme.

I have performed data cleaning on the tree columns `Size`, `Installs`, and `Price` from the [Google Play Store Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps).

1. `Size`: Size of the apps in mbs and kbs
2. `Installs`: Number of installs
3. `Price`: Price of the apps in Dollar($)
\
These columns were supposed to have a numerical data type, but due to some anomalies, they had an invalid data type. I have performed simple data cleaning techniques to fix these issues and convert these columns to the right data type for further Exploratory Data Analysis.
